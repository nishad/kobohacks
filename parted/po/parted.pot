#. TRANSLATORS:
#. Get translations for open and closing quotation marks.
#.
#. The message catalog should translate "`" to a left
#. quotation mark suitable for the locale, and similarly for
#. "'".  If the catalog has no translation,
#. locale_quoting_style quotes `like this', and
#. clocale_quoting_style quotes "like this".
#.
#. For example, an American English Unicode locale should
#. translate "`" to U+201C (LEFT DOUBLE QUOTATION MARK), and
#. should translate "'" to U+201D (RIGHT DOUBLE QUOTATION
#. MARK).  A British English Unicode locale should instead
#. translate these to U+2018 (LEFT SINGLE QUOTATION MARK)
#. and U+2019 (RIGHT SINGLE QUOTATION MARK), respectively.
#.
#. If you don't know what to put here, please see
